# **Cross Functional Team (CFT) Training Data Pipeline Automation- With Waitress, Flask, and MySQL**

This project automates the **end-to-end training data flow** from various sub-teams:

- General Training Team  
- Technical Training Team  
- Leadership Training Team  

The data from these teams is uploaded through a **Flask web interface** and deployed in production using **Waitress**.  
After upload, an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process is performed, and the data is stored in a **MySQL database**.  

An **automatic email** is sent to the training DRIs and respective leaders after each upload.


## **Project Structure**:

Project Root:
- .env file
- requirements.txt
- config.py
- templates
    - upload.html
- FLASK_with_ETL.py
- run_waitress.py
- daily_training_email.py
- export.py

## **Tech Stack**:

| Component        | Technology / Library    |
